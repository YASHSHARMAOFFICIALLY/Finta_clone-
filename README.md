Finta Landing Page (Hero Section) 🚀
A high-fidelity clone of the Finta hero section, built as a practice project to master Tailwind CSS and responsive web design.

🎯 Project Goal
The objective of this project was to replicate the clean, modern aesthetic of Finta's landing page. I focused on:

Precision Layout: Using Flexbox and Grid to align elements exactly like the original.

Responsive Design: Ensuring the hero section looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Tailwind Best Practices: Utilizing utility classes for spacing, typography, and custom color palettes.

✨ Features
Modern Hero Layout: Clean typography and high-impact CTA buttons.

Fully Responsive: Mobile-first approach.

Custom Hover States: Interactive elements built with Tailwind transitions.

Optimized Assets: Lightweight and fast loading.
