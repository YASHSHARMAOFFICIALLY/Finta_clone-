# Finta Landing Page (Hero Section) 🚀

A high-fidelity clone of the Finta hero section, built as a practice project to master Tailwind CSS and responsive web design.


## Project Goal

The objective of this project was to replicate the clean, modern aesthetic of Finta's landing page. I focused on:

1.Precision Layout: Using Flexbox and Grid to align elements exactly like the original.

2.Responsive Design: Ensuring the hero section looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

3.Tailwind Best Practices: Utilizing utility classes for spacing, typography, and custom color palettes.
